# Episodic developers' guide

This guide documents internal development practices for Episodic. Follow the
documentation style guide in `docs/documentation-style-guide.md` when updating
this file.

## Local development

- Use `uv` to manage the virtual environment and dependencies.
- Run `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` before proposing changes.
- Use the canonical content modules under `episodic/canonical` for schema and
  repository logic.
- The Makefile exports `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` so the
  `tei-rapporteur` bindings build against Python 3.14.

## Database migrations

Database migrations are managed with Alembic. The migration environment lives
under `alembic/`, and migration scripts are stored in `alembic/versions/`.
Schema changes must be expressed as migrations, and tests apply migrations
before executing database-backed scenarios.

### Creating a new migration

After modifying Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) models in
`episodic/canonical/storage/models.py`, generate a migration with Alembic's
autogenerate feature:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=<database-url> alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

Migration files follow the naming convention
`YYYYMMDD_NNNNNN_short_description.py` (for example
`20260203_000001_create_canonical_schema.py`).

### Schema drift detection

The `make check-migrations` target detects drift between the ORM models and the
applied migration history. It starts an ephemeral Postgres via py-pglite,
applies all Alembic migrations, and uses
`alembic.autogenerate.compare_metadata()` to compare the migrated schema
against `Base.metadata`. If they differ, the check exits non-zero and reports
the discrepancies.

Run it locally before committing model changes:

```shell
make check-migrations
```

### Continuous integration enforcement

The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs
`make check-migrations` on every push to `main` and on every pull request. A
pull request that modifies Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) models without an
accompanying Alembic migration will be blocked.

### Developer workflow

1. Modify ORM models in `episodic/canonical/storage/models.py`.
2. Generate a migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`.
3. Run `make check-migrations` to verify the models and migrations are in sync.
4. Run `make test` to confirm existing tests still pass.
5. Commit both the model changes and the new migration together.

## Database testing with py-pglite

Tests that touch the database use py-pglite to run an in-process PostgreSQL
instance. The fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` implement the approach described
in `docs/testing-sqlalchemy-with-pytest-and-py-pglite.md`.

Key expectations:

- Node.js 18+ is required because py-pglite runs a WebAssembly-based Postgres
  runtime.
- Tests run against Postgres semantics, not SQLite.
- Migrations are applied automatically for each test fixture instance.
- `EPISODIC_TEST_DB=sqlite` disables the py-pglite fixtures (tests that depend
  on them will be skipped).
- If a non-SQLite backend is requested while py-pglite is unavailable, the
  fixtures raise a clear error instead of silently skipping tests.

## Canonical content persistence

Canonical content persistence follows the hexagonal architecture guidance:

- `episodic/canonical/ports.py` defines repository and unit-of-work interfaces.
- `episodic/canonical/storage/` implements SQLAlchemy adapters and keeps
  persistence concerns out of the domain layer.
- `episodic/canonical/services.py` orchestrates ingestion workflows using the
  ports.
- `CanonicalUnitOfWork.flush()` is available when dependent records must be
  persisted before creating related rows (for example, approval events that
  reference newly created episodes).

### Repository usage

Each repository provides `add()` to persist a domain entity and `get()` (or
`get_by_slug()`, `list_for_job()`, `list_for_episode()`) to retrieve persisted
entities. Repositories translate between frozen domain dataclasses and
SQLAlchemy ORM records via mapper functions in
`episodic/canonical/storage/mappers.py`. Access repositories through the
unit-of-work rather than constructing them directly:

```python
async with SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork(session_factory) as uow:
    await uow.series_profiles.add(profile)
    await uow.commit()

    fetched = await uow.series_profiles.get(profile.id)
```

### Unit-of-work transaction semantics

The `SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork` manages transaction boundaries:

- `commit()` persists all pending changes to the database.
- `rollback()` discards all uncommitted changes within the current session.
- `flush()` writes pending changes to the database without committing, useful
  when dependent records require foreign-key references to exist within the
  same transaction.
- When the context manager exits with an unhandled exception, the unit of work
  rolls back automatically.

Database-level constraints (unique slugs, foreign keys, and CHECK constraints
such as the weight bound on source documents) are enforced by Postgres and
raise `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError` on violation.

## Logging

Structured logging uses femtologging. Import `get_logger` from
`episodic.logging` and emit messages via `log_info`, `log_warning`, or
`log_error` to keep log levels consistent.
