# Episodic developers' guide

This guide documents internal development practices for Episodic. Follow the
documentation style guide in `docs/documentation-style-guide.md` when updating
this file.

## Local development

- Use `uv` to manage the virtual environment and dependencies.
- Run `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` before proposing changes.
- Use the canonical content modules under `episodic/canonical` for schema and
  repository logic.
- The Makefile exports `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` so the
  `tei-rapporteur` bindings build against Python 3.14.

## Database migrations

Database migrations are managed with Alembic. The migration environment lives
under `alembic/`, and migration scripts are stored in `alembic/versions/`.
Schema changes must be expressed as migrations, and tests apply migrations
before executing database-backed scenarios.

### Creating a new migration

After modifying ORM models in `episodic/canonical/storage/models.py`, generate
a migration with Alembic's autogenerate feature:

    DATABASE_URL=<your-db-url> alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

Migration files follow the naming convention
`YYYYMMDD_NNNNNN_short_description.py` (for example
`20260203_000001_create_canonical_schema.py`).

### Schema drift detection

The `make check-migrations` target detects drift between the ORM models and the
applied migration history. It starts an ephemeral Postgres via py-pglite,
applies all Alembic migrations, and uses
`alembic.autogenerate.compare_metadata()` to compare the migrated schema
against `Base.metadata`. If they differ the check exits non-zero and reports
the discrepancies.

Run it locally before committing model changes:

    make check-migrations

### CI enforcement

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `make check-migrations` on
every push to `main` and on every pull request. A PR that modifies ORM models
without an accompanying Alembic migration will be blocked.

### Developer workflow

1. Modify ORM models in `episodic/canonical/storage/models.py`.
2. Generate a migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`.
3. Run `make check-migrations` to verify the models and migrations are in sync.
4. Run `make test` to confirm existing tests still pass.
5. Commit both the model changes and the new migration together.

## Database testing with py-pglite

Tests that touch the database use py-pglite to run an in-process PostgreSQL
instance. The fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` implement the approach described
in `docs/testing-sqlalchemy-with-pytest-and-py-pglite.md`.

Key expectations:

- Node.js 18+ is required because py-pglite runs a WebAssembly-based Postgres
  runtime.
- Tests run against Postgres semantics, not SQLite.
- Migrations are applied automatically for each test fixture instance.
- `EPISODIC_TEST_DB=sqlite` disables the py-pglite fixtures (tests that depend
  on them will be skipped).
- If a non-SQLite backend is requested while py-pglite is unavailable, the
  fixtures raise a clear error instead of silently skipping tests.

## Canonical content persistence

Canonical content persistence follows the hexagonal architecture guidance:

- `episodic/canonical/ports.py` defines repository and unit-of-work interfaces.
- `episodic/canonical/storage/` implements SQLAlchemy adapters and keeps
  persistence concerns out of the domain layer.
- `episodic/canonical/services.py` orchestrates ingestion workflows using the
  ports.
- `CanonicalUnitOfWork.flush()` is available when dependent records must be
  persisted before creating related rows (for example, approval events that
  reference newly created episodes).

## Logging

Structured logging uses femtologging. Import `get_logger` from
`episodic.logging` and emit messages via `log_info`, `log_warning`, or
`log_error` to keep log levels consistent.
