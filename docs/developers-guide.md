# Episodic developers guide

This guide documents internal development practices for Episodic. Follow the
documentation style guide in `docs/documentation-style-guide.md` when updating
this file.

## Local development

- Use `uv` to manage the virtual environment and dependencies.
- Run `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make test` before proposing changes.
- Use the canonical content modules under `episodic/canonical` for schema and
  repository logic.
- The Makefile exports `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` so the
  `tei-rapporteur` bindings build against Python 3.14.

## Database migrations

Database migrations are managed with Alembic. The migration environment lives
under `alembic/`, and migration scripts are stored in `alembic/versions/`.
Schema changes must be expressed as migrations, and tests apply migrations
before executing database-backed scenarios.

## Database testing with py-pglite

Tests that touch the database use py-pglite to run an in-process PostgreSQL
instance. The fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` implement the approach described
in `docs/testing-sqlalchemy-with-pytest-and-py-pglite.md`.

Key expectations:

- Node.js 18+ is required because py-pglite runs a WebAssembly-based Postgres
  runtime.
- Tests run against Postgres semantics, not SQLite.
- Migrations are applied automatically for each test fixture instance.
- `EPISODIC_TEST_DB=sqlite` skips py-pglite setup when a fallback is required.

## Canonical content persistence

Canonical content persistence follows the hexagonal architecture guidance:

- `episodic/canonical/ports.py` defines repository and unit-of-work interfaces.
- `episodic/canonical/storage.py` implements SQLAlchemy adapters and keeps
  persistence concerns out of the domain layer.
- `episodic/canonical/services.py` orchestrates ingestion workflows using the
  ports.
- `CanonicalUnitOfWork.flush()` is available when dependent records must be
  persisted before creating related rows (for example, approval events that
  reference newly created episodes).

## Logging

Structured logging uses femtologging. Import `get_logger` from
`episodic.logging` and emit messages via `log_info`, `log_warning`, or
`log_error` to keep log levels consistent.
